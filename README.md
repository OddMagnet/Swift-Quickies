# Why...

## Stack?
To practice extending types and adding conformances through extensions.

## LinkedList?
To see how using the `indirect` keyword makes it possible to have a LinkedList as a Struct instead of a class, with an Enum for the nodes

## Queue and Deque?
To experiement with constrained extensions, @inlinable and prioritization
